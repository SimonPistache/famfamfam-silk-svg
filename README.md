# FamFamFam Silk as SVG
> The iconic iconset of the 2010’s era from Mark James, remade in SVG for today’s needs.

This project contains ~1000 icons in SVG. SVG is lightweight, scalable compared to PNG — and open format, allowing anyone to edit it to his/her needs. I aim to have all the original icons remastered, but also create more up-to-date versions (Smartphones was not a thing back in 2008). Plus, most icons can be mixed with decorators (bullets) to get more meaning. 

Scale: <img height=16px src="icons/cup.svg"> <img height=24px src="icons/cup.svg"> <img height=32px src="icons/cup.svg"> <img height=48px src="icons/cup.svg"> <img height=64px src="icons/cup.svg">

Mix: ![Cup of caffee](<public/Cup of caffe.svg>) + ![Bullet delete](<icons/Bullet delete.svg>) = ![A cup of caffe with a delete bullet at its bottom right](<public/I should stop caffe.svg>)

Customize: ![Cup of caffee](<public/Cup of caffe.svg>) ![Cup of Matcha latte](<public/Cup of matcha.svg>) ![Cup of Tea](<public/Cup of tea.svg>) ![Cup of water](<public/Cup of water.svg>)

- Icon improvement based on existing icons must be as close as possible to the original design, especially at 16×16px.
- Icon must render without visual artefact in today's broswer such as WebKit, Blink, Gecko. (Test your icons)
