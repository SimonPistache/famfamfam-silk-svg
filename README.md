# famfamfam-silk-svg
A recreation of the iconic iconset of the 2010’s era from Marc James, remade in SVG and as a figma UI kit for today’s developpers and designers needs.

## License

I have not settled on the right licence for this product, so as for now I'll follow Mark James' Create Commons Attribution. He used 2.5, but I picked version 4.
I would like a more protective licence, one that could permit company and users to pick stuff here and use them in commercial products and marketing material, but prevent "stealing" stuff or changing ownership over minimal visual changes.
