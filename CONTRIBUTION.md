## Code of conduct

I believe that healthy debate and disagreement are essential to a healthy project and community. However, it is never ok to be disrespectful. Diverse opinions are welcomed as long as respect is maintained.

- Be friendly and welcoming.
- Be patient.
- Be thoughtful.
- Be respectful.
- Be charitable.
- Be constructive.
- Be responsible.

Not following the contributions guidelines may result in issues or PR closing or deletion, the ban of the user's account or reporting to Github staff.

## 🪄 Code contributions

> Code contribution can take form of new icons in SVG or changes to existing icons in the goal to improve them. The workflow is the classic Github *Fork* → *Commit* → *Push* → *Pull Request*.

Pull Requests should bind to the Github's best practices. They must follow the rules below:
- It must be related to an issue. Please create one before opening a PR.
- It must have the **Conventional Commit** principles in commit and PR names. I.e.: *fix(#33): Remove duplicate stroke on the main circle*
- Changes related to icons must follow icons design guidelines

## 🎨 Icon design guidelines

- Icons must be in the **style and spirit of the original work** from Marc James.
- Icons must be in **SVG**.
- Icons must be designed to be **legible in any size from 16×16px to 64×64px**. It must have the right balance between too much details and too little.
- Icon improvement based on existing icons must be as close as possible to the original design, especially at 16×16px.
- Icon must render without visual artefact in today's broswer such as WebKit, Blink, Gecko.
